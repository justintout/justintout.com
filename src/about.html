            Hi. I write code and talk a bunch.
            I'm an AI developer at Progressive Insurance.
            It's an intersting role with some lofty goals.
            Progressive is an increidble place to work (they're paying me, but not to say this).
          </p>
          <p>
            I used to be an open-source advocate at Progressive.
            It's was a cool gig - I got to build tools to make other Progressive
            developers' lives a little easier, while helping a huge company
            start to give back to the community.
            I'd recommend anyone with the opportunity to give advocacy/devrel a try.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a "past life," as they say, I was a software engineer at GE Ligthing, designing
            systems and integrations for <a href="//cbyge.com">C by GE</a> (they
            call it Cync now).
          </p>
          <p>
            Like many, my interest in software started from an early fascination
            with the Internet. I loved trying to understand the systems and
            interactions behind high-population online games. I first learned to
            code to create bots for
            <a href="//oldschool.runescape.com/">RuneScape</a> and
            <a href="//neopets.com/">NeoPets</a> in the early 2000's.
            <a href="//www.puzzlepirates.com/">Puzzle Pirates</a> taught me
            Excel, Poker, and, weirdly enough, economic theory. I believe video
            games are one of the best foundational education tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a few analog hobbies as well. I enjoy culinary arts in
            particular. My most recent focus has been fermented hot sauces. I
            also enjoy fishing, woodworking, and spending time with my family. I
            spend most day with my dog, Mango Mae <span class="indicator">🥭</span> and my daughter.
            You can keep up
            with my
            (mostly culinary) endeavors on
            <a href="//www.instagram.com/uncertain_and_unprecedented/">my Instagram.</a>
